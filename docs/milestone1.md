## Division of Labor

For dividing the labor, everyone will be working on different parts of the project. Everyone will be working on the class section of the webpage, with Charlie Le handling the bulk of the search and tag systems as well as the uploading system. Matthew Ferrara will work on the normal home page as well as the logged-in home page. He will also work on the add and manage class systems. Jia Hui Yu (Jerry) will be working on the flashcards- adding and editing flashcards and studying- as well as the note editor.
