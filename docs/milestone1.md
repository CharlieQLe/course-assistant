# Milestone 1

## Data Interactions

* Users can upload files that can be displayed if they are supported, such as text files.

* Users can create classes- internally, folders- to organize uploaded files.

* Users can "tag" uploaded files to organize and filter the data they want to find.

* Users can create files directly in the browser.

## Division of Labor

For dividing the labor, everyone will be working on different parts of the project. Everyone will be working on the class section of the webpage, with Charlie Le handling the bulk of the search and tag systems as well as the uploading system. Matthew Ferrara will work on the normal home page as well as the logged-in home page. He will also work on the add and manage class systems. Jia Hui Yu (Jerry) will be working on the flashcards- adding and editing flashcards and studying- as well as the note editor.

## Class Homepage, File Upload, and Tag System

The class homepage includes an interface that shows all files assigned to that class.  From there, the user is able to upload files and assign them with tags such as "lecture notes" for better organization.  They can also search for individual files by tag name and directly create note or flashcard files from this class homepage.  The ability to search is done via a search modal that allows the user to enter file name or what tags it includes.  The tag system is also accessed from this class homepage and has a modal that pops up displaying all current created tags along with the ability to add more.
