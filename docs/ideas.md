## Innovative Idea

This application will focus on helping students organize and manage their courses and their coursework. Students can add classes to place all their work in, and then tag their work to organize them furthur. Tags allow students to filter out specific documents that cover a certain set of material, or students can exclude documents with specific tags. While other applications are similar to storing and organizing schoolwork, those applications are focused on a general audience rather than specifically students. By focusing on students, features that are focused on education can be added to this application, such as flashcards.

## Important Components

* Classes act as folders to store sets of data such as documents or images in.
* Tags can be added on data such as documents or image to be more easily able to search and exclude sets of data. Data can have multiple tags for greater flexibility.
