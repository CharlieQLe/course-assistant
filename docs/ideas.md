## Innovative Idea

This application will focus on helping students organize and manage their courses and their coursework. Students can add classes to place all their work in, and then tag their work to organize them furthur. Tags allow students to filter out specific documents that cover a certain set of material, or students can exclude documents with specific tags. While other applications are similar to storing and organizing schoolwork, those applications are focused on a general audience rather than specifically students. By focusing on students, features that are focused on education can be added to this application, such as flashcards.

## Important Components

Important components of this include classes, tags, and the aforementioned educational features such as flashcards. Classes are folders that can store sets of data such as documents or images in. Users can add and remove classes. Within these classes, tags can be added on data such as documents or images to be more easily able to search and exclude sets of data. Data can have multiple tags for greater flexibility. For example, homework can be tagged as homework and the material it covers. Automatic tags based on file types will also be included to be able to filter out certain data types.
